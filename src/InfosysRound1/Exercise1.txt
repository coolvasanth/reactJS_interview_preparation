Difference Between Flex and Grid
	• Flexbox (Flex): 
		○ One-dimensional layout: Arranges elements in a row or column.
		○ Ideal for simple layouts with horizontal or vertical alignment.
		○ Responsive: Easily adapts to different screen sizes.
		○ Great for navigation bars, footers, and single-dimensional content sections.
	• CSS Grid (Grid): 
		○ Two-dimensional layout: Creates rows and columns for complex layouts.
		○ Superior for intricate structures with precise positioning.
		○ Responsive: Maintains flexibility across devices.
		○ Perfect for dashboards, product listings, and multi-column layouts.
Visual Demonstration: 
	• Flex: Show a navigation bar with elements aligned horizontally.
	• Grid: Display a product listing with items arranged in rows and columns.
Choosing Between Flex and Grid:
	• For simple layouts or single-dimensional alignment, flexbox often suffices.
	• For complex structures with precise positioning, opt for grid.
	• They can even be combined for more versatile layouts.
Example (Code Snippet):
JavaScript
// Flexbox for a navigation bar
<nav style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <a href="#">Home</a>
  <a href="#">About</a>
  <a href="#">Contact</a>
</nav>
// Grid for a product listing
<div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))' }}>
  <div className="product">Product 1</div>
  <div className="product">Product 2</div>
  {/* More products... */}
</div>
