What are promises ?

	• Promises: Represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.
	• Benefits: 
		○ Improved code readability and maintainability by handling asynchronous operations asynchronously.
		○ Chaining of asynchronous operations for a more fluid flow.
		○ Error handling for potential issues during asynchronous execution.

Code Example (Using Fetch API):
JavaScript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
    // Process the data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle errors
  });
