Difference between display: none vs. visibility: hidden

Both properties hide elements, but with subtle differences:

• display: none: Removes the element from the document flow entirely. 
    It doesn't occupy any space, and users won't see it. 
    (Imagine a ninja disappearing completely!)

• visibility: hidden: The element still occupies space in the layout,
  but it's invisible. Users might see a blank space where the element is
  hidden. (Think of a transparent sheet covering the element, 
  making it unseen but still present.)
