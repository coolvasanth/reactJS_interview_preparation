Why to use React over other framework ?	
    
    • Performance: React excels at handling dynamic UIs with 
            minimal re-renders, keeping your app fast and snappy.
    • Composability: React components promote code reusability, 
        making development faster and easier to maintain.
    • JSX: JSX syntax blends JavaScript with HTML, making UI 
        creation intuitive for developers.
