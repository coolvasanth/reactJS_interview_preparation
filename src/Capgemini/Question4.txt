What is <a> Tag and why to use it ?

The <a> tag is your link to the web world! It creates hyperlinks 
that, when clicked, navigate users to a different URL (or a different 
part of the same page, using internal links). But it's more versatile 
than you might think! You can use it for buttons, download links, 
and even email links.
