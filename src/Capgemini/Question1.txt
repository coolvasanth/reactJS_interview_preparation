1. What is React?
React â€“ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Imagine building UIs like Lego sets. Each Lego piece is a
 React component, a reusable code block that represents a 
 part of your UI. You can snap these components together to 
 create complex interfaces dynamically. React helps you 
 manage these components efficiently and keeps your UI in 
 sync with your data.
