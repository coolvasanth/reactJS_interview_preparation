// What is redux and it's usage ?

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, 
including React. It provides a centralized store to hold your
application's state, actions to update that state,
and reducers to handle those updates. Think of it as a central
bank for your app's data, ensuring everything stays organized and
consistent.
