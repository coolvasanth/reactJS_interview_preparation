Difference between Eslint and Jest:

• Eslint: Think of Eslint as a grammar police for your JavaScript code.
 It enforces coding style, catches potential errors, and helps maintain 
 code consistency. 

• Jest: Jest is your testing warrior. It helps you write unit tests to 
ensure your React components function correctly. You don't specify a 
percentage; Jest reports the test coverage, allowing you to identify 
areas for improvement.
