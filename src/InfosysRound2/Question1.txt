1. What are props in Reactjs ?

Building Blocks of Communication
Imagine building Lego houses. Each Lego piece has properties that 
define its color, size, and shape. Similarly, in React, props are 
properties passed down from parent components to child components. 
They act as a way for components to communicate and share data. 
This allows you to create reusable and dynamic components!
