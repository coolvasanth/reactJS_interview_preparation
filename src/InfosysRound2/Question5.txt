What are arrow functions in JS ?

Arrow functions (introduced in ES6) are a 
concise way to write JavaScript functions. 
They're often preferred for their cleaner syntax, 
especially when dealing with props and state in React components.

Example of an Arrow Function:
JavaScript

const handleClick = () => {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
};
handleClick()
