What are different Component Types: 

React offers two main types of components:

Class Components: These are like blueprints defining how a 
component behaves and renders. They use the class keyword and 
allow for functionalities like state management and lifecycle methods.

Functional Components: These are simpler and more concise. 
They are pure functions that take props as input and return JSX 
to describe what the component renders. They're a great choice 
for presentational components.
