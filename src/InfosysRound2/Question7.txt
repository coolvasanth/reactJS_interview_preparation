What is JSX is reactjs ?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows you to write 
HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code. This makes 
it easier to visualize and build user interfaces in React components.

Example of JSX:

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
    <p>This is some content.</p>
  </div>
);
