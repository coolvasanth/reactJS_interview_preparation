What are stateless components in react ?

Stateless components, essentially functional components, 
don't manage internal state. They simply take props as 
input and return JSX based on those props. This makes 
them lightweight and easier to reason about.

Example of a Stateless Component:


function Greeting(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
