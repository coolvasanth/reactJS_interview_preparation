What is redux ? and when to use it ?

Redux (although not strictly required for basic React applications)
is a popular state management library for managing complex application 
state. It provides a centralized store to hold your application's state, 
actions to update that state, and reducers to handle those updates.
(Think of it as a central bank for your app's data!)
