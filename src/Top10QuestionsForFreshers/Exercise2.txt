What is the difference between 
useEffect and useLayoutEffect? 

Answer:
A useEffect runs asynchronously 
after the paint has been committed to
 the screen, 
while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously
before the paint. This means 

useLayoutEffect 
can block the visual update, 
which is useful for measuring 
layout or updating the DOM 
before the browser paints.
